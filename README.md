# 🐭 Pikachu in Pure HTML & CSS

This project showcases a **hand-coded CSS-only representation of Pikachu**, created using only `<div>` elements and CSS styling. No images, SVGs, or background-image URLs are used — everything is built with basic HTML and CSS techniques.

## 💡 Problem Statement

Create a famous character (e.g., Pikachu, Mario) using only HTML and CSS. You may use:
- `<div>`, `<span>` elements
- CSS properties like `background`, `border-radius`, `box-shadow`, `transform`, and `position`

🚫 No:
- `<img>` tags
- SVGs
- Background images
- Art generators

---

## 🛠️ Approach & Solution

- Structure the character using nested `div`s for body parts.
- Style elements with CSS:
  - `border-radius` for curves (cheeks, eyes, ears)
  - `position: absolute` to place parts correctly
  - `transform` for tilt and rotation (tail, ears)
  - `@keyframes` to animate blinking eyes
- Tail is created with multiple rotated boxes.
- Responsive layout using `flexbox`.
